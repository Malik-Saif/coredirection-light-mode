Core Direction offers the ability to process payments through the Services (“Payment Processing Services”). Payment Processing Services are provided by our third party payment processing partners as Third Party Offerings and any procurement by you or your Affiliates will be subject to a separate merchant agreement which will be solely between you (or your Affiliate) and the third party processor. If you use Payment Processing Services you agree that you and your Affiliates will comply with the terms and conditions of any applicable merchant agreements and all applicable card network rules, policies, laws and regulations, at all times while using such Payment Processing Services.
                                                        At Core Direction's sole discretion, you may be offered Payment Processing Services provided by Stripe (“Core Direction Payments”). Core Direction Payments are subject to the <a class="external-link" href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>, which includes the <a class="external-link" href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Terms of Service</a> (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”) and subject to certain fees and surcharges communicated to you during the enrollment process and as may be updated by Core Direction from time to time. By enrolling in Core Direction Payments, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Core Direction enabling Payment Processing Services through Stripe, you agree to provide Core Direction accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Core Direction to share it and transaction information related to your use of the Payment Processing Services provided by Stripe pursuant to our <a class="external-link" href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. To the extent permitted by law, we may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by deducting the corresponding amounts from funds payable to you arising from the settlement of card transactions through Core Direction Payments. Fees will be assessed at the time a transaction is processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for such transactions. If the settlement amounts are not sufficient to meet your obligations to us, we may charge or debit the bank account or credit card registered in your account for any amounts owed to us. In the event a consumer chargeback or dispute occurs, you may be charged up to fifteen dollars ($15) per occurrence by Core Direction. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of this Agreement. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest. Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement. If we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you. In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts may be charged with fees that are incidental to the collection of delinquent accounts and chargebacks including, but not limited to, collection fees and convenience fees and other third parties charges. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to Core Direction by you. Such communication may be made by Core Direction or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.
                                                        Core Direction may offer special pricing, credits, and/or discounts to you or your Affiliates for the Services contingent upon timely procurement, and continued material usage, of the Payment Processing Services and/or Core Direction Payments. In the event you or your Affiliate stop utilizing the Payment Processing Services and/or Core Direction Payments, Core Direction may, in its sole discretion, revoke the special pricing, credits, and/or discounts being applied to the Services.</li>
