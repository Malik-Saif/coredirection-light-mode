                                                <p class="sidebar-item-content-desc">Some non- EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available at <a class="external-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en</a>). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission (the United States) we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses (based on the clauses published at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087, a copy of which can be obtained by emailing <a class="external-link" href="mailto:privacy@coredirection.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@coredirection.com</a>, see below) and/or participation in the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield to protect your Personal Information in the U.S as further explained below.

By decision dated July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Consequently, we are relying on standard contractual clauses (based on the clauses published at <a class="external-link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087</a>, a copy of which can be obtained by emailing <a class="external-link" href="mailto:privacy@coredirection.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@coredirection.com</a>, see below) for transfers of personal data from the EEA.</p>
                                                <p class="sidebar-item-content-desc">Nonetheless, and in addition to standard contractual clauses, we are committed to subjecting all personal data received from EEA member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.

                                                <p class="sidebar-item-content-desc">Core Direction is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under each Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Core Direction complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
                                                <p class="sidebar-item-content-desc">With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Core Direction is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
                                                <p class="sidebar-item-content-desc">If you think your personal data has been transferred pursuant to a Privacy Shield Framework and you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a class="external-link" href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>
